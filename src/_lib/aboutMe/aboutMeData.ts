    content: `After graduating from college with a focus on Automation and Applied Informatics, but without earning a degree, I spent a few years working at my first job. In addition to my primary responsibilities, 
      I also took on tasks such as resolving technology problems on various devices (e.g., PCs/laptops, printers, portable mobile terminal lasers) and creating small programs in Microsoft Excel to perform calculations. 
      Eventually, I decided to pursue my passion for programming more seriously. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned full-stack web development. My favorite part of programming is watching each component of my project 
      grow and become a useful tool for others and solving problem. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is React, Next.js, Node.js and MongoDB. I am also familiar with TS, SQL, Tailwind... see more.
       I am always looking to learn new technologies. i am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer. Outside of coding, I prioritize fitness, whether it's hitting the gym or spending quality time with my dog or cat.
        I have a strong passion for continuous learning and am currently exploring System Design concepts.`,
